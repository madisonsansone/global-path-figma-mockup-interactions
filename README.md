# Global Path: Study Abroad Application – App Mockup

This repository contains the mockup and prototype for **Global Path**, an application designed to guide prospective study abroad students through every step of the decision-making process. The mockup was created in Figma and includes interactive screens, flows, and user interactions demonstrating the app’s functionality.

## Project Overview

**Global Path** helps students make informed study abroad decisions by providing insights beyond what program websites offer. Key features include:

- **Alumni-Driven Insights:** Crowdsourced reviews and ratings on topics such as credit transfers, class difficulty, cultural immersion, travel costs, housing, local transportation, and language learning.
- **AI-Driven Chatbot:** Personalized guidance using conversational memory to help students narrow down program choices.
- **Q&A Forum:** Connect with alumni to get direct answers to specific questions.
- **Wishlist Feature:** Save programs of interest and add personalized notes for long-term planning.
- **Multi-Platform Design:** Optimized for both mobile and desktop, with quick-search functionality on mobile and comprehensive research tools on desktop.

Global Path uniquely addresses the core concerns of study abroad students by integrating program research, comparison, and networking into one seamless platform.

## User Research & Design Process

This project was completed as a **group of three** for Human Computer Iterfaces, using **Goal-Directed Design (GDD)** methodology. Our process included:

- Conducting **2-hour alumni interviews** with prospective study abroad students.
- Synthesizing insights into:
  - **15+ factoids** about student priorities and challenges
  - **User scenarios** illustrating typical decision-making workflows
  - An **abstract summarizing key findings** to guide design decisions

The mockups and interactions were informed directly by these insights to ensure a user-centered, realistic design.
